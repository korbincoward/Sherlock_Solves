Analysis:
Operation Dream Job was a sophisticated campaign that employed advanced techniques to conduct cyberespionage and attempt to discredit government entities that do not align with the regime. As tensions between western civilization and North Korea continue to increase
the most likely course of action will be an increase of offensive cyber operations against western governments and contractors to discredit them and create a lack of trust. We will also see an increase of attacks on the financial sector as a means to fund
the regime and their weapons procurement plans. Their least likely course of action will to decrease offensive cyber operations and only target government agencies.
